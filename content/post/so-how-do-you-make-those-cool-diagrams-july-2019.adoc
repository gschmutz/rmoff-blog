I https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin/[write] and http://talks.rmoff.net/[speak] lots about Kafka, and get a fair few questions from this. The most common question is actually nothing to do with Kafka, but instead: 

> How do you make those cool diagrams? 

I wrote about this originally link:/2018/12/10/so-how-do-you-make-those-cool-diagrams/[last year] but since then have evolved my approach. I've now pretty much ditched https://paper.bywetransfer.com/[Paper], in favour of https://concepts.app/en/[Concepts]. It was recommended to me after I published the previous post.

I still use the Apple Pencil + iPad, but Concepts is vector-based, supports layers, grids, guidelines…is generally more powerful. Concepts is definitely worth the cost (and learning curve). It doesn't have _quite_ the same 'hand drawn' feel to it, but it's close enough for what I want whilst not spending my life re-drawing bitmaps for every permutation of a diagram's lifecycle :)

I've also dabbled with using Keynote's native drawing capabilities with the Apple Pencil, but the resolution and flexibility isn't quite there to use it beyond quick scribbles. I do find it useful for sketching out what I want to say when I'm building the flow of a deck, that I'll then go back and transform into proper diagrams or words. Kinda like using dead trees (paper), but better.

My workflow is thus: 

1. Optionally, sketch out the flow of a talk across slides in Keynote, using Keynote's drawing function to write/sketch out ideas across multiple slides
2. Use Concepts on the iPad to build diagrams
3. Copy objects / entire drawings in Concepts onto the clipboad. Apple magic pixies make these appear on my Mac's clipboard, which I then paste into Keynote
4. Use text objects in Keynote to overlay notations. At the moment I'm using Kalam font, previously used Indie Flower and Burst my Bubble.
