BONUS: I'm planning to setup https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/tree/race-tracker/mqtt-tracker[a demo] based on Simon Aubury's excellent https://github.com/saubury/race-mapper[race-mapper]. Each person shares their location from their phone during the run to an MQTT server which is then streamed to Kafka and KSQL for some funky viz in Kibana.

⚠️️️️️️⚠️ **This involves sharing your personal location. You can do the run/walk without signing up for this app! It's a purely optional exercise if you want to join in with it. Don't take part unless you want to do that! No guarantees made around data security etc!** ⚠️⚠️ 

If you want to participate, here are the instructions: 

1. Download OwnTracks (https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/owntracks/id692424691[iOS] / https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android&hl=en_GB[Android])
2. Download https://www.dropbox.com/s/06mrdqdaznazw0c/owntracks.otrc?dl=1[this configuration file] on your phone and open it in OwnTracks
3. Once set up go to the Info screen (top-left icon) and you should see **Status** as `connected`. From the main Map screen set the mode to **Move**.

**What about my data?** The data's uploaded to an MQTT server running on https://www.cloudmqtt.com[CloudMQTT]. The user writing the data has write-only access. I have a Kafka Connect worker pulling that data into a Kafka cluster, from which I'll show Kibana visualisations of the run as people do it. If you don't want to share your data, that is absolutely fine. This is just a fun experiment :)
