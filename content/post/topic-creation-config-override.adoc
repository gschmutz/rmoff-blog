When Kafka Connect ingests data from a source system into Kafka it writes it to a topic. Assuming you have set `auto.create.topics.enable = true` then it will create these topics for you, and do so using the defaults configured on the broker for topic creation, including https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_num.partitions[`num.partitions`] and https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_default.replication.factor[`default.replication.factor`]. 

There are many other https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs[topic-level configurations] which you may want to set for topics that are automatically created by Kafka Connect. This is particularly true for connectors which are creating a large number of topics, or where the topic name is not known in advance (e.g. when using a regex to select objects from the source system) and thus cannot be pre-created with the desired settings. Common settings for a topic that you may want to customise include https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs_cleanup.policy[cleanup.policy], https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs_min.insync.replicas[min.insync.replicas], and https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs_compression.type[compression.type]. 

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-158%3A+Kafka+Connect+should+allow+source+connectors+to+set+topic-specific+settings+for+new+topics[KIP-158] was implemented in Apache Kafka 2.6 (available with Confluent Platform 6.0), and adds the ability to set topic-level configurations for topics created by Kafka Connect source connectors.

== Just the defaults, ma'am. 

Here's a very simply Kafka Connect source connector, reading data in from a file:

[source,javascript]
----
curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" \
     http://localhost:8083/connectors/source-txt-file-00/config \
     -d '{
        "connector.class": "org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSourceConnector",
        "key.converter"  : "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "topic"          : "testdata-00",
        "file"           : "/data/test.txt"
        }'
----

Since the broker is configured to automagically create new topics (`auto.create.topics.enable = true`), it does so and using the defaults - one partition, replication factor of 1, etc. We can examine this using various tools: 

* `kafka-topics`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kafka-topics --bootstrap-server broker:29092  --topic testdata-00 --describe
Topic: testdata-00      PartitionCount: 1       ReplicationFactor: 1    Configs:
        Topic: testdata-00      Partition: 0    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1
----

* `kafkacat`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kafkacat -b broker:29092 -L -J|jq '.topics[] | select(.topic =="testdata")'
----
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "topic": "testdata-00",
  "partitions": [
    {
      "partition": 0,
      "leader": 1,
      "replicas": [
        {
          "id": 1
        }
      ],
      "isrs": [
        {
          "id": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

== Setting the configuration for auto-created topics

Let's see how we can use the new options in Apache Kafka 2.6 (Confluent Platform 6.0) to change some of the topic configurations that are set when it's created. 

=== Attempt 1 â€¦ Crashed and burned, Mav

image::/images/2021/01/crashed_and_burned.gif[Crashed and burned! Huh, Mav?]

In my sandbox I just have a single broker so I'm going to leave the number of replicas as a sensible setting of 1, but I'm going to change the number of partitions to four, as well as the cleanup policy from its default of `delete` to instead `compact`. 

[source,javascript]
----
curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" \
     http://localhost:8083/connectors/source-txt-file-01/config \
     -d '{
        "connector.class"                          : "org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSourceConnector",
        "key.converter"                            : "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "value.converter"                          : "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "topic"                                    : "testdata-01",
        "file"                                     : "/data/test.txt",
        "topic.creation.default.partitions"        : 4,
        "topic.creation.default.replication.factor": 1,
        "topic.creation.default.cleanup.policy"    : "compact"
        }'
----

NOTE: If you are setting topic creation overrides you *must* include `replication.factor` and `partitions` even if you're not specifying a value that's different from the broker default. 

In the broker log you can see that the `cleanup.policy` configuration has been honoured (`{cleanup.policy=compact}`): 

[source,bash]
----
[2021-01-06 12:03:04,184] INFO Creating topic testdata-01 with configuration {cleanup.policy=compact} and initial partition assignment HashMap(0 -> ArrayBuffer(1), 1 -> ArrayBuffer(1), 2 -> ArrayBuffer(1), 3 -> ArrayBuffer(1)) (kafka.zk.AdminZkClient)
----

But! Alas! the connector fails: 

[source,bash]
----
[2021-01-06 12:03:04,346] ERROR WorkerSourceTask{id=source-txt-file-01-0} failed to send record to testdata-01:  (org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.WorkerSourceTask)
org.apache.kafka.common.InvalidRecordException: This record has failed the validation on broker and hence will be rejected.
----

The `FileStreamSourceConnector` sends records with no key set, which for a compacted topic makes no sense, and hence we get `org.apache.kafka.common.InvalidRecordException`. 

=== Attempt 2â€¦  I don't know, but uh, it's looking good so far.

image::/images/2021/01/looking_good.gif[I don't know, but uh, it's looking good so far.]

Let's try a different variation just to prove out the topic configuration: 

[source,javascript]
----
curl -i -X PUT -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" \
     http://localhost:8083/connectors/source-txt-file-02/config \
     -d '{
        "connector.class"                          : "org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSourceConnector",
        "key.converter"                            : "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "value.converter"                          : "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "topic"                                    : "testdata-02",
        "file"                                     : "/data/test.txt",
        "topic.creation.default.partitions"        : 4,
        "topic.creation.default.replication.factor": 1,
        "topic.creation.default.compression.type"  : "snappy"
        }'
----

In the Kafka Connect worker log you can see the settings used (under the covers it's done through `TopicCreationGroup`): 

[source,bash]
----
[2021-01-06 12:11:29,256] INFO Created topic '(name=testdata-02, numPartitions=4, replicationFactor=1, replicasAssignments=null, configs={compression.type=snappy})' using creation group TopicCreationGroup{name='default', inclusionPattern=.*, exclusionPattern=, numPartitions=4, replicationFactor=1, otherConfigs={compression.type=snappy}} (org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.WorkerSourceTask)
----

Checking out the topic details we can see it's as we wanted it - four partitions, and using snappy compression ðŸ’¥

[source,bash]
----
$ kafka-topics --bootstrap-server broker:29092  --topic testdata-02 --describe

Topic: testdata-02      PartitionCount: 4       ReplicationFactor: 1    Configs: compression.type=snappy
        Topic: testdata-02      Partition: 0    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1
        Topic: testdata-02      Partition: 1    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1
        Topic: testdata-02      Partition: 2    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1
        Topic: testdata-02      Partition: 3    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1
----

== Topic Creation Groups

In the example above I used just the `default` topic creation group, but you can create multiple groups of configuration based on the topic name. 

I can see this being really useful if you want to override topic configuration for just _some_ of the topics that a connector creates but not all of them, or you want to override configuration for all topics but vary it by topic based on the topic name.
