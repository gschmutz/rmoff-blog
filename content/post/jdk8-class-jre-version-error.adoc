This article is just for Googlers and my future self encountering this error. Recently I was building a Docker image from the ksqlDB code base, and whilst it built successfully the ksqlDB server process in the Docker container when instantiated failed with a `UnsupportedClassVersionError`:

{{< highlight shell >}}
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: javafx/beans/value/ObservableValue has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 54.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0
{{< /highlight >}}


Here's how I fixed it, courtesy of help from my colleagues Colin and Tim. 

1. Download https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK 8 ("Java SE")] and install it
+
** On my Mac I had an existing Java, https://medium.com/@devkosal/switching-java-jdk-versions-on-macos-80bc868e686a[this article] showed how to list them and switch between them

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ /usr/libexec/java_home -V

Matching Java Virtual Machines (2):
    12.0.2, x86_64:	"OpenJDK 12.0.2"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-12.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home
    1.8.0_241, x86_64:	"Java SE 8"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_241.jdk/Contents/Home
{{< /highlight >}}

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` for your current shell to JDK 8
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`
{{< /highlight >}}

3. In the same shell, run 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
`mvn clean`
{{< /highlight >}}

4. In the same shell, run the actual Maven build, which will now be done under Java 8 and should work ðŸ¤ž
