I've been blogging for quite a few years now, starting on Blogger, soon onto WordPress, and then to Ghost a couple of years ago. Blogger was fairly lame, WP yucky, but I really do like Ghost. It's simple and powerful and was _perfect_ for my needs. My needs being, an outlet for technical content that respected formatting, worked with a markup language (Markdown), and did _f**k things up_ in the way that WP often would in its WYSIWYG handling of content. 

I ran Ghost self-hosted on AWS EC2, and herein lay the start of this particular story. Whilst 20 years ago, even 10 years ago, I'd quite happily spend an evening immersed in a hack project to get something working, times are different now. With a wife and two kids—and a fair bit of travel for work—the time I have at home I don't want to be spending on _getting shit to work_. And therein lies the beauty of PaaS. Never mind cloud-bollocks or what the acronyms stand for—in essence you write your blog, and someone else worries about all the rest of it. SSL certificate expired? Not my problem. Ghost needs upgrading? Not my problem. Whereas if you self-host…_totally_ your problem. 

In addition, paying for my AWS costs out of my pocket started to grate just a little. A few bucks here and there kinda add up over the course of a couple of years. Nothing major, but enough to make me pause and look around. The final itch I had was Markdown. Now https://rmoff.net/tags/markdown/[I do like Markdown], but a little less than I used to—and that's because I found Asciidoc. Asciidoc finishes what Markdown starts. All the slightly limited functionality in Markdown once you get beyond `*bold*` and `_italic_`, asciidoc swoops in and gives you in spades. And as much as I liked Ghost, it doesn't support Asciidoc.
