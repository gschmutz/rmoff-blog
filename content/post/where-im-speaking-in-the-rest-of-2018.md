There's lots going on in the next few months :-) 

I'm particularly excited to be speaking at several notable conferences for the first time, including JavaZone, USENIX LISA, and Devoxx. 

As always, if you're nearby then hope to see you there, and let me know if you want to meet for a coffee or beer!
