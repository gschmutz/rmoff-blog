Prompted by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59629748/ksql-aggregating-data-based-on-last-1-year-365-days[a question on StackOverflow] I had a bit of a dig into how windows behave in ksqlDB, specifically with regards to their start time. This article shows also how to create test data in ksqlDB and create data to be handled with a timestamp in the past. 

For a general background to windowing in ksqlDB see https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/concepts/time-and-windows-in-ksqldb-queries/[the excellent docs]. 

The nice thing about recent releases of ksqlDB/KSQL is that you can create and populate streams directly with `CREATE STREAM` and `INSERT INTO` respectively. Much as I love kafkacat, being able to build a whole example within the ksqlDB CLI is very useful. 

== Create the stream 

This creates the stream as well as the underlying topic. Since the topic doesn't exist already I've specified its name and also `PARITIONS` - without these ksqlDB won't create it for me. 

{{< highlight sql >}}
CREATE STREAM SOURCE_DATA (OP_TS BIGINT, CUSTOMER VARCHAR, COST INT) 
  WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='MY_DATA', 
        VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO', 
        PARTITIONS=1, 
        TIMESTAMP='OP_TS');
{{< /highlight >}}

Note that I've created `OP_TS` to hold the timestamp as an epoch (hence `BIGINT`) and indicated to ksqlDB that this column is to be used as the timestamp for the records when doing any time-based processing. By default ksqlDB will use the timestamp of the Kafka message. 

== Populate the stream

Using https://www.epochconverter.com/ for ease I came up with a handful of times within the past year, and inserted messages into the stream for these: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
INSERT INTO SOURCE_DATA (OP_TS, CUSTOMER, COST) VALUES (1549715863000, 'A',1);
INSERT INTO SOURCE_DATA (OP_TS, CUSTOMER, COST) VALUES (1560083863000, 'A',1);
INSERT INTO SOURCE_DATA (OP_TS, CUSTOMER, COST) VALUES (1574339863000, 'A',1);
INSERT INTO SOURCE_DATA (OP_TS, CUSTOMER, COST) VALUES (1575981463000, 'A',1);
INSERT INTO SOURCE_DATA (OP_TS, CUSTOMER, COST) VALUES (1576931863000, 'A',1);
INSERT INTO SOURCE_DATA (OP_TS, CUSTOMER, COST) VALUES (1578573463000, 'A',1);
{{< /highlight >}}

== Query the stream 

Here's how the data looks. Note a few things: 

1. The use of `TIMESTAMPTOSTRING` to make the milliseconds-since-epoch more readable
2. The `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` function is used to do some date maths to show how long ago from now the timestamp is. 
3. `ROWTIME` and `OP_TS` match, because that's what we told ksqlDB with the `WITH TIMESTAMP` clause in the `CREATE STREAM`. If we hadn't, then the `ROWTIME` would just be the time at which the rows were `INSERT`ed above. 

{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(ROWTIME,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London') AS ROWTIME_STR,
             TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(OP_TS,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London')   AS OP_TS, 
             (UNIX_TIMESTAMP()-OP_TS) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 AS DAYS_DIFF , 
             CUSTOMER, 
             COST 
        FROM SOURCE_DATA 
        EMIT CHANGES;

== Tumbling window examples

Here's the output of tumbling windows of various sizes. 

* 7 Days
+
{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(WINDOWSTART(),'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London') AS WINDOW_START_TS, 
             CUSTOMER, 
             SUM(COST) 
        FROM SOURCE_DATA 
                WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 7 DAYS) 
        GROUP BY CUSTOMER 
        EMIT CHANGES ;

+----------------------+----------+------------+
|WINDOW_START_TS       |CUSTOMER  |KSQL_COL_2  |

This is pretty much what we'd expect to see

* 31 days
+
I was hoping for a month, but ksqlDB only supports:
+
[source,bash]
----
Caused by: line 1:160: mismatched input 'MONTH' expecting {'DAY', 'HOUR',
        'MINUTE', 'SECOND', 'MILLISECOND', 'DAYS', 'HOURS', 'MINUTES', 'SECONDS',
        'MILLISECONDS'}
----
+
Hence here's 31 days instead: 
+
{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(WINDOWSTART(),'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London') AS WINDOW_START_TS, 
             CUSTOMER, 
             SUM(COST) 
        FROM SOURCE_DATA 
                WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 31 DAYS) 
        GROUP BY CUSTOMER 
        EMIT CHANGES ;    

+-----------------------+----------+------------+
|WINDOW_START_TS        |CUSTOMER  |KSQL_COL_2  |
+-----------------------+----------+------------+
|2019-01-22 00:00:00    |A         |1           |
|2019-05-26 01:00:00    |A         |1           |
|2019-10-28 00:00:00    |A         |1           |
|2019-11-28 00:00:00    |A         |2           |
|2019-12-29 00:00:00    |A         |1           |
{{< /highlight >}}
+
Note that two of the values (for `2019-12-10`, `2019-12-21`) fall within the same window (starting `2019-11-28`)

* 365 days
+
As noted above ksqlDB support `DAYS` as the largest unit of time, so I'll have to approximate 1 year ~~ 365 days
+
{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(WINDOWSTART(),'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London') AS WINDOW_START_TS, 
             CUSTOMER, 
             SUM(COST) 
        FROM SOURCE_DATA 
                WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 365 DAYS) 
        GROUP BY CUSTOMER 
        EMIT CHANGES ;    

+-----------------------+----------+------------+
|WINDOW_START_TS        |CUSTOMER  |KSQL_COL_2  |
+-----------------------+----------+------------+
|2018-12-20 00:00:00    |A         |4           |
|2019-12-20 00:00:00    |A         |2           |

So this is where it gets interesting - looking back on the query output above you can see we only have data within the last year, but for a tumbling window of 365 days we're getting two values, starting on December 20th of two consecutive years. 

== Window start *date*

When calculating an time window *within a day* the window starts at midnight. For a window greater than a day, it seems that the window *date* from which the window end date is calculated is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time[Unix time] (which also ties in with window sizes less than a day starting a midnight). 

Let's double-check this assumption. Unix time starts at 1st January 1970 00:00:00. Taking our window size of 365 days, this is: 

[]
|========
|days	|365
|hours	|8760
|minutes	|525600
|seconds	|31536000
|millseconds	|31536000000
|========

Now let's look at the epoch returned by `WINDOWSTART()`: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> SELECT WINDOWSTART() AS WINDOW_START_EPOCH,
             CUSTOMER,
             SUM(COST)
        FROM SOURCE_DATA
                WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 365 DAYS)
        GROUP BY CUSTOMER
        EMIT CHANGES ;

+--------------------+---------+-----------+
|WINDOW_START_EPOCH  |CUSTOMER |KSQL_COL_2 |
+--------------------+---------+-----------+
|1545264000000       |A        |4          |
|1576800000000       |A        |2          |
{{< /highlight >}}

The first of these is `1545264000000`. What do we get if we divide this by the number of milliseconds in a 365-day window (`31536000000`)? We find that it fits *exactly*: `1545264000000âž—31536000000 = 49`. 

This suggests that if you want to build monthly or yearly aggregates in ksqlDB that start based on the Gregorian calendar markers, ksqlDB will need to add support for `MONTH` and `YEAR` as window sizes (_tracking in https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/1968[issue #1968]_).
