Last time I looked at creating my link:/2020/07/14/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s02e03-kafka-go-consumer-channel-based/[first Apache Kafka consumer in Go], which used the now-deprecated channel-based consumer. Whilst idiomatic for Go, it has some issues which mean that the function-based consumer is recommended for use instead. So let's go and use it!

Instead of reading from the `Events()` channel of the consumer, we read events using the https://docs.confluent.io/5.5.1/clients/confluent-kafka-go/index.html#Consumer.Poll[`Poll()`] function with a timeout. The way we handle events (a `switch` based on their `type`) is the same: 

[source,go]
----
switch ev.(type) {

    case *kafka.Message:
        // It's a message

    case kafka.PartitionEOF:
        // We've finished reading messages on this partition so let's wrap up
}
----

We also remove the Go routine and its slightly more complex execution logic in which channels were used to indicate when to terminate processing, and instead just use a `for` loop: 

[source,go]
----
doTerm := false
for !doTerm {
    // do polling until we're done
}
----

Just like in the previous example, when we receive a `PartitionEOF` we then go to exit (since we make the BIG assumption that we're only consuming from one partition)

The full code looks like this: 

[source,go]
----
include::/Users/rmoff/git/rmoff-blog/content/code/go/kafka/consumer02/consumer02.go[]
----

I run it using a link:/code/go/kafka/consumer02/docker-compose.yml[Docker Compose] which also runs a data generator in Kafka Connect populating a topic for the consumer to read from. When I shut down Kafka Connect the data generator stops, the consumer reads to the end of the topic, and exits:
