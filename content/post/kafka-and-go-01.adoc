To install the Confluent Go client you need to run 

[source,go]
----
go get gopkg.in/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go.v1/kafka
----

With that done, we can run our first Kafka Go code! Make sure you've got a local Kafka broker running first, and then give this a spin: 

[source,go]
----
include::/Users/rmoff/git/rmoff-blog/content/code/go/kafka/producer01/producer01.go[]
----

When you run this, you get a message written to a Kafka topic!

== Don't try this at home!

Well, try it at home. But don't take it anywhere near _actual code_ that you need to write. As the comments in the code above show, there is *NO* error handling, whatsoever. I'm going to explore that in subsequent posts, but want to start at the very simplest example to start with here. 

== IDE FTW

(WTF? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment[IDE] https://www.yourdictionary.com/ftw[FTW])

The VS Code environment is nice and helpful for writing Go and brings in function definitions etc

You can press Ctrl and click on a function or type and it will take you through to the definition, which is often quicker than looking up the API documentation
