When you create a sink connector in Kafka Connect, by default it will start reading from the beginning of the topic and stream all of the existingâ€”and newâ€”data to the target. The setting that controls this behaviour is `auto.offset.reset`, and you can see its value in the worker log when the connector runs: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
[2019-08-05 23:31:35,405] INFO ConsumerConfig values:
        allow.auto.create.topics = true
        auto.commit.interval.ms = 5000
        auto.offset.reset = earliest
â€¦
{{< /highlight >}}

If you want Kafka Connect to start reading from the _end_ of the topic instead, you need to set `auto.offset.reset=latest`. There are two ways to do this: 

1. Override it at the *Worker* level, which impacts _all connectors on that worker_. That is, your connector will start from the end of the topic, but so will any other connector created on that worker. You could create different workers, but it's not very elegant. 
+
** To do this, add the following to your `connect-distributed.properties` (or equivalent if you're using standalone mode): 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
consumer.auto.offset.reset=latest
{{< /highlight >}}


2. As of Apache Kafka 2.3 (available as part of https://www.confluent.io/download/[Confluent Platform 5.3]) you can now override consumer (and producer) properties *per connector* ðŸ™Œ. Note that this is _not enabled by default_. 
+
** To do this you first need to allow it in the **worker** config: 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
connector.client.config.override.policy=All
{{< /highlight >}}
+
[NOTE]
=====
If you're using Docker then the configuration is set through the environment variable `CONNECT_CONNECTOR_CLIENT_CONFIG_OVERRIDE_POLICY`, for example in Docker Compose would look like this:

{{< highlight shell >}}
CONNECT_CONNECTOR_CLIENT_CONFIG_OVERRIDE_POLICY: 'All'
{{< /highlight >}}
=====

** Once that's set, you can change the consumer properties that you want to in each connector's configuration individually. For example: 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
"consumer.override.auto.offset.reset": "latest"
{{< /highlight >}}

** You can check the worker log and you'll see: 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
â€¦

''''

* If you try to override the consumer/producer configuration and you have *not* set the policy on the worker as above then it will fail when you try to create the connector: 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
Connector configuration is invalid and contains the following 1 error(s):
The 'None' policy does not allow 'auto.offset.reset' to be overridden in the connector configuration.
{{< /highlight >}}

* On Apache Kafka 2.2 and below, the override will simply be ignored.
