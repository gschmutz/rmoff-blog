Coming to Kafka Summit in San Francisco next week? Inspired by https://www.facebook.com/oraclesqldev/photos/gm.1401265536847886/1228813493825348/?type=3&theater[similar events] at Oracle OpenWorld in past years, I'm proposing an unofficial run (or walk) across the GoldenGate bridge on the morning of Tuesday 1st October. We should be up and out and back in plenty of time to still attend the morning keynotes. Some people will run, some may prefer to walk, it's open to everyone :)

It's a total of 6km / 3.8 miles. You can see it https://www.strava.com/routes/21896823[on Strava here].

Here's the plan: 

* **Tuesday 1st October @ 06:50** Meet at the GoldenGate bridge (duh), in the https://goo.gl/maps/ABfQ3NBxHzeNWXU88[car park next to the visitor center]. Take a group photo / https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit[#streamingselfie]
+
Lyft/Uber is probably easiest to get there (c.20 minutes from the Hilton Union Square). 
* 07:00 run/walk across the bridge to https://goo.gl/maps/yixyEvWeznGNoB2x6[the other side] where we'll take another group photo & more https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit[#streamingselfie]
* Run/walk back to the other side, Uber/Lyft back and then on to Kafka Summit day two keynotes which start at 09:00

It's an unofficial run—so up to you to arrange your own transport, etc. Use Twitter (#KafkaSummitBridgeRun) or the #summit channel on the http://cnfl.io/slack[Community slack group] if you want to arrange sharing rides etc.

BONUS: I'm planning to setup https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/tree/race-tracker/mqtt-tracker[a demo] based on Simon Aubury's excellent https://github.com/saubury/race-mapper[race-mapper]. Each person shares their location from their phone during the run to an MQTT server which is then streamed to Kafka and KSQL for some funky viz in Kibana.

⚠️️️️️️⚠️ **This involves sharing your personal location. You can do the run/walk without signing up for this app! It's a purely optional exercise if you want to join in with it. Don't take part unless you want to do that! No guarantees made around data security etc!** ⚠️⚠️ 

If you want to participate, here are the instructions: 

1. Download OwnTracks (https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/owntracks/id692424691[iOS] / https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android&hl=en_GB[Android])
2. Download https://www.dropbox.com/s/06mrdqdaznazw0c/owntracks.otrc?dl=1[this configuration file] on your phone and open it in OwnTracks
3. Once set up go to the Info screen (top-left icon) and you should see **Status** as `connected`. From the main Map screen set the mode to **Move**.

**What about my data?** The data's uploaded to an MQTT server running on https://www.cloudmqtt.com[CloudMQTT]. The user writing the data has write-only access. I have a Kafka Connect worker pulling that data into a Kafka cluster, from which I'll show Kibana visualisations of the run as people do it. If you don't want to share your data, that is absolutely fine. This is just a fun experiment :)
