Alfred is one of my favourite productivity tools. One of its best features is the clipboard history, which when I moved laptops and it didn't transfer I realised quite _how_ much I rely on this functionality in my day-to-day work.

Whilst Alfred has the options to syncronise its preferences across machines, it seems that it doesn't synchronise the clipboard database. To get it to work I did the following:

1. Shut down Alfred on both machines. 
2. On the **source** machine go to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Alfred/Databases/` and move `clipboard.alfdb` and `clipboard.alfdb.data` to Dropbox
3. Make sure Dropbox is running and has sync'd the files to the **target** machine.
4. On the **target** machine create a symbolic link:
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
$ ln -s ~/Dropbox/Alfred/Databases/clipboard.alfdb ~/Library/Application\ Support/Alfred/Databases/clipboard.alfdb
$ ln -s ~/Dropbox/Alfred/Databases/clipboard.alfdb.data ~/Library/Application\ Support/Alfred/Databases/clipboard.alfdb.data
{{< /highlight >}}
+
If the location of the files on your Dropbox is different then modify the `ln` paths accordingly. 
5. Restart Alfred on the target machine.

NOTE: This was a one-time migration; I don't know if it works bi-directional because Alfred would be running when the SQLite `clipboard.alfdb` got updated. If you try it and it works then let me know and I'll update this post.
