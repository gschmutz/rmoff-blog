I use Docker and Docker Compose _a lot_. Like, every day. It's a fantastic way to build repeatable demos and examples, that can be torn down and spun up in a repeatable way. Butâ€¦what happens when the demo that was working is spun up and then tail spins down in a blaze of flames?

Here's the excerpt of a log from my Oracle container:

Argh! It was working just yesterday! 

If you check out the space that Docker's using, you'll see it can be quite a hog

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ docker system df
TYPE                TOTAL               ACTIVE              SIZE                RECLAIMABLE
Images              86                  7                   36.87GB             35.87GB (97%)

That's over 70Gb of space! 

If you load up the Docker UI you'll see that it's got a fixed size for the disk image that contains all the Docker data:

image::/images/2019/01/2019-01-09_10-48-49.png[]

You could increase this size, or you could tidy up some of the unused content. You can prune these down easily, using the `prune` command. Go carefully though, because if you trash all your images then they're going to have to be pulled back down from their repository or rebuilt, and that can take some time. Don't do it just before you need to run the demoâ€¦

NOTE: You can do `docker system prune -af` but this trashes **everything**. I'd recommend taking a more structured approach to it, as shown below. 

Pruning the unused volumes and stopped containers is easy: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ docker volume prune
WARNING! This will remove all local volumes not used by at least one container.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Volumes:

You can do the same with images, but I don't want to trash _all_ my images, so I cheat and use a GUI - the excellent https://www.portainer.io/[Portainer] (which itself can be run under Docker ðŸ˜ƒ)

image::/images/2019/01/2019-01-09_10-25-34.png[]

Now my Docker has a bit more space to breathe: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ docker system df
TYPE                TOTAL               ACTIVE              SIZE                RECLAIMABLE

Local Volumes       1                   1                   33.57kB             0B (0%)

This same problem can cause Elasticsearch to stop working also, if it runs out of space the index becomes read-only: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
{"error":{"root_cause":[{"type":"cluster_block_exception","reason":"blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];"}],"type":"cluster_block_exception","reason":"blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];"},"status":403}
