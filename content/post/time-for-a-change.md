After 5 years at Rittman Mead, [126 blog posts](https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/author/robin-moffatt/), [16 conferences](https://speakerdeck.com/rmoff/), [four](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-993649) [published](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-1010305) [OTN](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-1009358) [articles](https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-1006400), an [Oracle ACE award](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/otn/f?p=19297:4:::NO:4:P4_ID:10100) - not to mention, of course, a whole heap of interesting and challenging client work - I've decided that it's time to do something different. 

Later this month I'll be joining [**Confluent**](https://confluent.io) as a **Partner Technology Evangelist**, helping spread the good word of Apache Kafka and the [Confluent platform](https://www.confluent.io/product/).
