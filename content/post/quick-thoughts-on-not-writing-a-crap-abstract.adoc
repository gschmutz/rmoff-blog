I've reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made: 

- No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I've not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you're going to talk about? Possible exception would be the "hot" tech companies where people will see a talk just because it's Netflix etc
- I really really don't want just to read your project documentation/summary. It makes me worry your talk will be death by PowerPoint of the minutiae of something that's only relevant in your company. 
- Following on from above, I want to see that there's going to be things you'll share _that are useful for other people in a similar situation_. Something that's specific to your project, your company, doesn't translate to mass-usefulness. Something that other people will hit, whether it's technical or org-cultural, now _that_ is interesting and is going to be useful
- If my eyes start to glaze over reading the abstract intro, already I'm assuming that your talk will make me bored too. Read it back out loud to yourselfâ€¦make sure each word justifies its place in the text. Boilerplate filler and waffle should be left on the cutting floor. 
- You need to strike a balance between giving enough detail about the contents of your talk that I am convinced you have interesting things to share, but without listing every nut and bolt of detail. Too much detail and it just becomes a laundry list. You need to whet people's appetite for the actual meal, not put them off their food. 

This is all just IMHO, and I would strongly caveat it that I've never been on a program committee, so maybe others out there can set me straight if I'm going against the grain on any of this.
