To help future Googlersâ€¦ with the Confluent docker images for Kafka, KSQL, Kafka Connect, etc, if you want to access JMX metrics from within, you just need to pass two environment variables: 

* `KSQL_JMX_HOSTNAME` - the hostname/IP of the *host* machine. This is used by the JMX client to connect back into JMX, so must be accessible from the _host machine running the JMX client_. If you're just running your JMX client locally on the Docker host, you can set this to `127.0.0.1`
* `KSQL_JMX_PORT` - a port on which you want to access the metrics. Make sure you expose this port through Docker

If you don't set `KSQL_JMX_HOSTNAME` then the Docker launch script uses the _host details of the container_, which results in connectivity problems. 

From [jmxterm](http://wiki.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm/) you'll get errors like: 

```
$ java -jar ~/Downloads/jmxterm-1.0.0-uber.jar
Welcome to JMX terminal. Type "help" for available commands.
$>open localhost:18088
#RuntimeIOException: Runtime IO exception: Connection refused to host: 192.168.144.4; nested exception is:
        java.net.ConnectException: Operation timed out (Connection timed out)
```

or 

```
$ java -jar ~/Downloads/jmxterm-1.0.0-uber.jar
Welcome to JMX terminal. Type "help" for available commands.
$>open localhost:18088
#RuntimeIOException: Runtime IO exception: Failed to retrieve RMIServer stub: javax.naming.CommunicationException [Root exception is java.rmi.ConnectIOException: error during JRMP connection establishment; nested exception is:
        java.io.EOFException]
```

For JConsole it'll just hang/timeout, or appear to work but disconnected.
