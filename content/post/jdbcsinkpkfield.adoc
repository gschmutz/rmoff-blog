I wanted to get some data from a Kafka topic: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> PRINT PERSON_STATS FROM BEGINNING;
Key format: KAFKA (STRING)
Value format: AVRO
rowtime: 2/25/20 1:12:51 PM UTC, key: robin, value: {"PERSON": "robin",
 "LOCATION_CHANGES":1, "UNIQUE_LOCATIONS": 1}
{{< /highlight >}}

into Postgres, so did the easy thing and used Kafka Connect with the https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-jdbc/sink-connector/index.html[JDBC Sink connector]. 

<!--more-->

I wanted to use `UPSERT` behaviour based on the key of the Kafka message (as shown above, `robin`), so set `pk.mode = record_key`. Unfortunately this didn't work and errored out with: 

    Need exactly one PK column defined since the key schema for records is a primitive type, defined columns are: []

Hmmmmm, I was puzzled. How can I specify a field name for something that's the message key? 

Turns out that if you've got a primitive field, *you* need to specify the field name _that is to be created on the target table._

So this works: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
…
pk.mode = record_key
pk.fields = 'PERSON'
…
{{< /highlight >}}

Which then creates a table in the target database like this: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
postgres=# \d "PERSON_STATS"
                Table "public.PERSON_STATS"
      Column      |  Type  | Collation | Nullable | Default
------------------+--------+-----------+----------+---------
 PERSON           | text   |           | not null |
 LOCATION_CHANGES | bigint |           |          |
 UNIQUE_LOCATIONS | bigint |           |          |
Indexes:
    "PERSON_STATS_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree ("PERSON")
{{< /highlight >}}

with data that updates in place as changes are made to the topic in Kafka
