_Is a blog even a blog nowadays if it doesn't include a "Here is my home office setup"?_

Thanks to conferences all being online, and thus my talks being delivered from my study—and https://twitter.com/search?q=speakerselfie%20(from%3Armoff)&src=typed_query&f=live[my habit of posting a #SpeakerSelfie] each time I do a conference talk—I often get questions about my setup. Plus, I'm kinda pleased with it so I want to show it off too ;-)

* https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-34UC99[LG 34UC99] - ultrawide

== Other kit

* Apple Magic Keyboard
* Apple Trackpad
* Elgato Stream Deck
** Quick way to control wi-fi lights, bring up a terminal, display a clock, etc (yes, I'm massively under-using its possibilities)
* Blue Yeti microphone
** Does the job but there's probably better options out there 
* https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/brio[Logitech Brio] webcam
** Pretty good, but pales in comparison to the fancy new Blackmagic 6k that I just got and will blog about…sometime :D
* https://www.luxburgvisual.com/luxburg-220x200-cm-professional-portable-green-backdrop-chromakey-background-for-photo-video-live-game-virtual-studio.html[Luxburg Green screen] 
** not shown, but really good piece of kit

== Software

* https://www.macbartender.com/[Bartender 3]
** Nice tool for arranging as well as hiding all the menu bar icons - handy when you're presenting from your screen or recording a screencast
* http://displaymenu.milchimgemuesefach.de/[Display Menu]
** Great tool for quickly changing display resolution on different monitors
* https://manytricks.com/moom/[Moom]
** Excellent utility for using the keyboard to move windows between desktops and resize to pre-configured places
* https://itunes.apple.com/app/webcam-settings/id533696630?mt=12&at=1l3vngI&ct=blogger[Webcam Settings]
** Does a better job at keeping the Brio configuration set properly than the Logitech software does
* https://obsproject.com/[OBS Studio] + https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam[Virtual Camera plugin]
** I'm only dabbling with this and using it as a way to use my greenscreen when presenting on platforms that don't support it
